Cloud trail has something called "CloudTrail Insights events"; what is this?

Docs say:

> AWS CloudTrail Insights helps AWS users identify and respond to unusual activity associated with API calls and API error rates by continuously analyzing CloudTrail management events

The docs also say "If your trail is configured to log read-only or no management events, you cannot turn on CloudTrail Insights event logging."; Hmm..why would you use it to log only read-only events or no management events?
